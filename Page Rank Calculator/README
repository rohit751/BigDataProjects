1. Download our mapper, reducer, 'pageRankBash.sh' and the input files from the blackboard. Place them in your local path: "/home/cloudera/"

2. The script 'pageRankBash.sh' contains all the necessary commands to execute the Page Rank MapReducer in the hadoop file system.

3. Give appropriate executing permisions for yourself:
	chmod 775 /home/cloudera/pageRankBash.sh

4. Follow this syntax to execute the bash script: "/home/cloudera/pageRankBash.sh <max Iterations> <Initial Page Rank> <Damping Factor>"
   For example: "/home/cloudera/pageRankBash.sh 10 0.01 0.85"

5. After the commands are executed, output will be generated in the following path on the hadoop file system: '/user/cloudera/output_PageRank'

6. The bash script will also copy this output folder to your local folder.

7. Inside the '/home/cloudera/output_PageRank/' folder, we can find the result file as 'part-00000'.
